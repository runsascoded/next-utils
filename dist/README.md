# next-utils
Repository of components for reuse across [next.js] projects

Currently:
- a `<Head>` wrapper for `next/head`, that makes it easy to add various `<meta>`/OpenGraph tags: [src/head.tsx](src/head.tsx)
- a `<Nav>` component implementing a simple responsive navbar (with customizable styling)

Example usages:
- [bikejc/bike-master-plan](https://github.com/bikejc/bike-master-plan/blob/main/pages/index.tsx#L7)
- [neighbor-ryan/turnpiketrap](https://github.com/neighbor-ryan/turnpiketrap)
